## 🔧 Environment Setup
To create a new conda environment, run the following command:

```bash
conda create --name disdiff python==3.9
```
## ⚡Activate Environment
Activate the created environment with:
```bash
conda activate disdiff
```

## 📦 Install Required Packages
You need to install the following packages using pip:
```bash
pip install diffusers==0.13.1
pip install torch
pip install transformers
pip install accelerate
```

## 🔍 Locate StableDiffusionPipeline
Open `offloading.py` in your code editor. Hold `ctrl` key if you are on Windows or `command` key if you are on Mac, and click on `StableDiffusionPipeline`

![Location of StableDiffusionPipeline](readme/img1.png)

This will navigate to the file `pipeline_stable_diffusion.py`. To locate this file in your directory, right-click on the filename and choose 'open in' -> 'finder'.
